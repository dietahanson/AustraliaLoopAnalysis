Predator foraging behaviour drives food-web topological structure.

Mesocosm manipulations with 
* 2 top-predator fish with contrasted feeding behavior
* 4 biomass levels

Instantaneous food webs are instances of the cumulated matrix Lazzaro_74.nw0.

Codes for file names:

1) Date of sampling - experiment starts day 0.
	day_14, day_21, day_28 
	-> state of the food web 14, 21, 28 days after the start of the experiment 
 

2) Two top-predator fish with contrasting feeding behavior:
	BG = Blue Gill (visual feeder)
	GS = Gizzard shad (filter feeder)

3) Biomass levels and mesocosm identification:
	B10-4  = Blue Gill, 10 individuals, mesocosm N° 4
	S10-17 = Gizzard Shad, 10 individuals, mesocosm N° 17
