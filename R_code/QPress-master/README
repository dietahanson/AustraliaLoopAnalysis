# QPress

This package simulates qualitative press perturbation scenarios for network models 
specified as signed directed graphs. 

The package has four main functions.

* The package reads signed directed graphs from pre-specified formats
  and generates a community matrix.

* The package samples a community matrix to generate a set of outcomes 
  which can explored interactively.

* The package provides a means to specify combinations of validation
  criteria and press perturbation scenarios, and to determine the 
  proportion of simulated outcomes that meet these specifications.
